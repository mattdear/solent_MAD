<h1>Mobile Application Development - Part 8</h1>
<h1>File I/O</h1>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Today we will look at how to perform <em>file input/output (file I/O)</em> in Java.
This will allow you to save data to file and load it back in again from your apps.
Note that this topic is applicable to <em>any</em> Java applications: it will work on
both Android and regular Java applications.</p>

<p>
</p><h2>Streams</h2>

<ul>
<li>To understand file I/O it is useful to understand the meaning of the 
term <em>stream</em></li>
<li>A <em>stream</em> is simply the flow of data from one thing to another</li>
<li>Examples of streams:
    <ul>
    <li>Keyboard input (keyboard to memory)</li>
    <li>Screen output (memory to screen)</li>
    <li>File input and output (memory to and from file)</li>
    <li>Network input and output (memory to and from another machine on the
    network)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>In Java, each type of stream is a class</li>
<li><em>System.out</em> is a standard stream representing output to screen</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>Streams in Java</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Java standard library has a number of different types of stream</li>
<li>There are a number of independent ways in which these can be 
subdivided including:
    <ul>
    <li>Input vs. output streams</li>
    <li>Low level vs. wrapper streams</li>
    <li>Byte vs. character streams</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>1. Input vs. output streams</h2>

<ul>
<li>The simplest distinction to make</li>
<li> An <em>input stream</em> represents
<em>input</em> to the program (from file, keyboard, network, etc)</li>
<li>An <em>output stream</em> represents <em>output</em> from the program (to
file, screen, network etc)</li>
</ul>

<p></p>


<p>
</p><h2>2. Low level vs Wrapper Streams</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Low level streams:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Interact directly with the data source, e.g. the file or the network
    connection</li>
    <li>Read or write <em>single bytes</em></li> 
    <li>e.g. FileInputStream, FileOutputStream</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wrapper streams:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>These <em>filter</em> data, taking in data in one format and outputting
    it in another</li>
    <li>Provide a high-level interface to allow us to convert 
    the raw bytes read or written by low level streams
    to and from actual data types (e.g. int, float and even objects)</li>
    <li>Typically <em>wrapped</em> round a low level stream; the constructor 
    takes a low level stream as an argument</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>Low Level vs Wrapper Streams - Input</h2>

<img src="./Part 8_ File I_O_files/javastreams2.png" alt="Java input streams, 
low level and wrapper">

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>Example of a Low Level Stream - FileInputStream</h2>

<pre class="codebox">FileInputStream fs=new FileInputStream("bytes.bin");    
byte[] bytes=new byte[10];
if (fs.read(bytes) != 10)
{
    System.out.println("Less than 10 bytes read. File corrupted");
    System.exit(1);
}
</pre>
<ul>
<li>This example reads in 10 bytes from file and stores them in an array</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>Example of a wrapper stream - the DataOutputStream</h2>

<ul>
<li>An output wrapper stream</li>
<li>Wraps FileOutputStream</li>
<li>e.g.
<pre class="codebox">import java.io.*;
public class FileEx1
{
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
        try
        {
            FileOutputStream fs = new FileOutputStream("data.bin");
            DataOutputStream ds = new DataOutputStream(fs);
            ds.writeInt(1);
            ds.writeChar('b');
            ds.writeDouble(3.1415927);
            ds.close(); // close the file to ensure data is flushed to file
        }
        catch(IOException e)
        {
            System.out.println (e);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Note that the <em>catch IOException</em> block is to handle any errors
that might occur; next term we will consider "exceptions" in more
detail</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>DataOutputStream - Notes on example</h2>

<ul>
<li>Note the <em>wrapping</em> of streams here</li>
<li>The DataOutputStream takes in ints, chars
and doubles, but passes out a stream of raw bytes (hence it is acting as
a <em>filter</em>)</li>
<li> The raw bytes are then passed to the FileOutputStream which
actually writes them to file.</li>
<li>The DataOutputStream <em>wraps</em> the FileOutputStream</li>
<li>This is 
similar to the way that ObjectOutputStream <em>wraps</em> FileOutputStream
when writing whole objects to file</li>
<li>Same principle for input: wrap a DataInputStream round a FileInputStream
to convert raw bytes read in from file to higher-level data types e.g.
<pre>FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream("data.bin");
DataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(fs);
int i = ds.readInt();
char c = ds.readChar();
double d = ds.readDouble(); 
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>Object Streams</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>ObjectInputStream</em>
and <em>ObjectOutputStream</em> can be used to save and load
<em>whole objects</em> to and from file</li>
<li>This process is known as <em>serialization</em></li>
<li>To <em>serialise</em> an object means to save its state to file so that
it can later be read in unchanged</li>
</ul>

<p></p>




<p>
</p><h2>Byte streams vs Character Streams</h2>

<p>A further division of stream types is that between 
<em>byte streams</em> and <em>character streams</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Byte streams</strong>: 
    <ul>
    <li>Exist within the InputStream and 
    OutputStream inheritance hierarchies</li>
    <li>Deal with transfer of 
    <em>single bytes</em> to and from file</li>
    <li>Typically used for input and output of binary data</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Character streams</strong>: 
    <ul>
    <li>Exist within the <em>Reader</em> and 
    <em>Writer</em> inheritance hierarchies</li>
    <li>Deal with transfer of <em>Unicode 
    characters</em> (data type char) to and from file 
        <ul class="subpoint">
        <li> The <em>char</em> data type in Java consists of <em>2</em>
           bytes due to the use of Unicode for representing international 
        characters)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Typically used for text input and output</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>Example of character streams - Text I/O</h2>

<ul>
<li>To account for Unicode, when performing text I/O we use Readers and Writers
</li>
<li>
To <em>output</em> data, we wrap the raw <em>FileWriter</em> stream (used to 
actually write the raw Unicode to file) in the high-level stream 
<em>PrintWriter</em>, which allows us to use formatted printing 
(e.g. \n) as we would normally do to screen.</li>
<li>Text <em>input</em> is a little different. We use the corresponding
<em>FileReader</em> as the low-level stream, but this time we wrap it in
<em>BufferedReader</em> to enhance the efficiency of the file read. </li>
<li>
(There is no <em>PrintReader</em>, as there is no corresponding input 
operation to the formatted output that <em>PrintWriter</em> facilitates).</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>Example of character streams - Text I/O</h2>

<pre class="codebox">import java.io.*;
public class FileEx2
{
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
        try
        {
            PrintWriter pw = 
                new PrintWriter( new FileWriter("data.txt"));

            pw.println("Hello");
            pw.println("It's a nice day!");
            pw.close(); // close the file to ensure data is flushed to file
        }
        catch(IOException e)
        {
            System.out.println ("I/O Error: " + e);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>Reading from a text file</h2>

<ul>
<li>When <em>reading</em> from a text file, we can make use of the
BufferedReader class</li>
<li>This is another use of wrapper streams. We use <em>FileReader</em> as the low-level stream
(this reads the stream as a character stream, so we can deal with Unicode characters) and then
wrapped as a BufferedReader, so that data is buffered in memory as it is read in (for efficiency)</li>
<li>We repeatedly call the BufferedReader's <em>readLine()</em> method (which returns the next line) until
there are no more lines to read (in which case <em>readLine()</em> will return null)</li>
<li>e.g:
<pre>import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileRead
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("marks.txt"));
            String line = "";
            while((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
            {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        }
        catch(IOException e)
        {
            System.out.println("ERROR: " + e);

        }
    }
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2>File formats</h2>

<p>File formats can be <em>binary</em> or <em>text-based</em>. A binary file (examples being common image
formats such as JPEG or PNG) consists of the raw bytes making up the data (such as the image). Typically,
binary files also contain a <em>header</em> which <em>describes</em> the data. For example, an image file
might contain a header which describes the colour-depth (bits per pixel) and the width and height of the image.
Code which reads the file can make use of the header to determine how to intepret the rest of the data.
Binary files cannot be easily read in a text editor.
</p>

<p>By contrast, text files can be read and understood in a text editor. There are a number of structured ways in 
which data can be stored in a text file. Two standard formats, XML and JSON, will be covered later in the course.
A simpler, common way of storing text data is a <em>comma-separated values (CSV)</em> file. In a CSV file, each item of data
is stored in one line, and different aspects of the data are separated by commas. For example, a file containing
staff contact details might look like this:
</p><pre>Tony,Rees,RM601,3456
David,Osguthorpe,RM602,3334
Mark,Cranshaw,RM603,3122
</pre>
Note how the CSV file contains each aspect of the data (first name, surname, room, phone extension) separated by commas.
CSV files are quite easy to interpret: we can use <em>BufferedReader</em> to read the file (as above) and then use
the <em>split</em> method of <em>String</em> to split up each individual line. Here is an example of reading a CSV file
into a series of <em>Staff</em> objects (exception handling not shown, for clarity):
<pre>ArrayList&lt;Staff&gt; staff = new ArrayList&lt;Staff&gt;();
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("staff.csv"));
String line;
while((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
{
    String[] components = line.split(",");
    if(components.length==4)
    {
        Staff currentStaff = new Staff (components[0], components[1], components[2], components[3]);
        staff.add(currentStaff);
    }
}
</pre>
Note how this is working. We read in each line, and use the <em>split()</em> method to split the current line into an array
of its individual components. We then check that the length of the array is the expected value (4 - first name, surname, room,
extension) and if so, create a new Staff object using the individual components of the line and add it to the ArrayList of Staff.

<h2>Android-specific file IO issues</h2>

<h3>Default directory</h3>

<p>

Having looked at general Java file I/O, we are now going to look at where data can be saved on a mobile device. Typically a device
has a file system either internally on the device or on an SD card, depending on the model. There is a default root (top-level) directory
(folder) to the file system, however you do not hardcode the location of this root directory in the same way that you would
specify the C: drive on Windows. Instead you use the method <em>Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()</em> to obtain the top-level 
directory on the device. This returns an object of type <em>File</em>; you then use the <em>getAbsolutePath()</em> method to obtain
a String containing the full path to the top-level directory. Here is a full example which would work on Android:
</p><pre>import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import android.os.Environment;
import android.app.AlertDialog;

try
{
    FileReader fr = new FileReader(<em>Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath()</em> + "/marks.txt");
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(fr);
    String line = "";
    while((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
    {
        // do something with each line...
    }
    reader.close();
}
catch(IOException e)
{
    new AlertDialog.Builder(this).setPositiveButton("OK", null).
        setMessage("ERROR: " + e).show();

}
</pre>

<p></p>

<p>
Note how we specify the filename using the top-level directory plus the filename.
Also note the use of <em>AlertDialog.Builder</em> to display an alert dialog showing the error if an IOException is thrown.
This is an inbuilt Android method which "builds" an alert dialog with the supplied parameters. Here we can see that we set the message on the
dialog to the result of the exception's toString() method and then show it. Without the <em>show()</em> call, the alert dialog would never be shown. 
</p>
<p>Noe also the use of "method chaining". Each method in this line of code returns a copy of the AlertDialog object, so that we can call a further method on it.
Another example:
</p><pre>new AlertDialog.Builder(this).setMessage ("Error loading").setPositiveButton("Dismiss", null).show();</pre>
This example specifies custom text on the AlertDialog's OK button. The second parameter to <em>setPositiveButton()</em> (null here) allows you to 
specify a listener for the button, to set up custom event handling if necessary.
<p></p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>Any Android app which saves to file or loads back needs to have the appropriate permissions granted in the manifest file. Make sure that you add one or both
(as appropriate) of the following permission
lines to the manifest (before the &lt;application&gt; tag):
</p><pre>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&gt;
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<ol>
<li>Write a simple text-editor/notepad app with Android. The main activity should consist of a single EditText occupying the whole
of the screen.
The user should be able to enter some text in the EditText.  Note that you can make the text inside the EditText align to the top by adding the
property <em>android:gravity="top"</em> to the &lt;EditText&gt; tag in the layout XML file. There should be two 
menu options labelled "Save" and "Load". When the user
selects "Save", it should save the contents of the EditText 
to a text file "textedit.txt". 
The text file should be saved in the directory returned by
<pre>Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath()</pre>
If the text file preference has not been set, use the filename "textedit.txt".
When the user selects "Load", the EditText should be filled with the contents 
of "textedit.txt".</li>
<li>Handle exceptions with the use of <em>AlertDialog.Builder()</em> as shown above.</li>
<li>Test that it has worked by navigating the file system of your emulator. 
To view the file, use the <em>Device File Explorer</em> (you can access this
by clicking on the label on the right-hand side of the window).
Your file will be saved in <em>/storage/sdcard</em> or
<em>/storage/emulated/0</em>, dependent on the device.</li>
<li>Change your app so that the user can specify the filename in the
preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<h3>Advanced exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write a simple address book app. The main activity should contain an ArrayList of Contact objects.
 The user should be able to add a contact using the main Activity;
there should be separate EditTexts for first name, last name, phone number and address, as shown below:
<br>
<img src="./Part 8_ File I_O_files/addressbook.png" alt="Address book layout">
<br>
There should be four menu items, "Add", "Save", "Load"
and "Search". These should work as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>When the user selects Add, the current text in the EditTexts should be used to create a new Contact object which is added to
    the ArrayList of Contacts.</li>
    <li>When the user selects Save, the contacts in the ArrayList should be saved as a CSV file (just call it
    contacts.csv).</li>
    <li>When the user selects Load, the current contacts.csv file should be opened, and the ArrayList of Contacts filled with them. </li>
    <li>Finally when the user
    selects Search, the ArrayList should be searched for the contact with the same last name as that currently in the last-name EditText,
    and the first-name, phone number and address EditTexts filled in with the appropriate values for the matching Contact. (Assume that no two contacts
    have the same last name).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
